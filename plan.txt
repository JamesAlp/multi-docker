Making an overly complex fibonance caluclator to gain experience with multi container application

- Nginx web server
 - will do application routing to react server and express server
- react server
 - frontend
 - will make ajax request to express server
- express server
 - backend api
 - receives request, saves index to postgres db
- redis
 - will use to cache values
 - will be used to store "calculated values" data
 - store all indices and calculated values as key-value pairs
- worker (?)
 - watches redis for new indices
 - pulls each new index
 - calculates new value then puts it back into redis
- postgres db
 - will be used to store "values i have seen" data

 Flow:
 - push to github
 - github actions builds a test image, tests code
 - github actions builds prod images
 - github actions push images to docker hub
 - github actions pushes project to AWS EB
 - EB pulls images drom docker hub, deploys
